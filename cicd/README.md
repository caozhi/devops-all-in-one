# Experimenting the CICD process with Jenkins Pipeline and Ansible

Implemented a Jenkins Pipeline to mock a whole pipeline from prepare to production. 
Using ansible to implement the deployment process.

## Start Up a Cluster

```shell
./mock.sh
```

The script will using docker compose to start a cluster with 6 containers. Then init the cluster like init pass-free env from ansible host to other servers.

## jenkins/Jenkinsfile

Jenkins pipeline. Read the code, youâ€™ll know how it works. Also you can visit the Jenkins server for more detail: http://47.104.217.100:8080/job/PIPELINE

## Ansbile Folder

Ansible project for production deployment. Allow two option:
ansible-playbook deploy.yml -e action=upgrade
ansible-playbook deploy.yml -e action=rollback
